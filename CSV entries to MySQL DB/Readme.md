# Filter Excel with data:
This script is an upgraded version of my previous work of Excel to Mysql upload that was very inefficent.
# Working
This script allows us to take any "File.csv" file and append all entries to a table in MySQL. 
# Usage
Rename any csv file as "File.csv", and edit the python file for your mysql server.
That is it.
